5th project. 
We needed to create a basic 2D game.
The program takes a [filename].ber file which has the map as an input.
The map can be composed of only these 5 characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, C for a collectible, E for a map exit and P for the player’s starting position.
The map must contain 1 exit, at least 1 collectible, and 1 starting position to be valid.
The map must be rectangular.
The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it’s not, the program must return an error.
You have to check if there’s a valid path in the map.
