# 🎮 so_long – My First 2D Game!

For my sixth project at Hive Helsinki, I created a basic 2D game using MiniLibX! 🕹️ The game loads a map from a .ber file and follows some strict rules:

🗺️ The map must:
✅ Be rectangular
✅ Be fully surrounded by walls (no escaping!)
✅ Have one exit (E), at least one collectible (C), and one player start position (P)
✅ Contain only these valid characters:

    0 = Empty space

    1 = Wall

    C = Collectible

    E = Exit

    P = Player

Before the game starts, the program validates the map to make sure there’s a way to collect all items and reach the exit. 🚪 If not, it throws an error! ⚠️

This project was an awesome mix of graphics, file handling, and pathfinding—plus, I got to make my very own game! 🎉
My favorite project so far, loved to create something visual ! 🎨
